I am interested in computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing.
Will be updated [soon]().

### Other projects

* **Non-smooth Stochastic Optimization for MCMC**  
*Probabilistic Graphical Models (10-708), Spring 2015*  
Instructor: Prof. Eric Xing  
**Abstract:**  
How do we sample efficiently from the Bayesian Lasso in a high dimensional problem with a large dataset? Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) has grown in popularity because it enables more efficient exploration of the state space in high-dimensional problems.
Also, Stochastic Gradient-HMC has been proposed to enable application of HMC to large datasets. 
However, these methods apply to sampling from smooth energy functions only. We propose two ways of dealing with this: 
(1) SPG-HMC: Stochastic Proximal Gradient-HMC, to enable sampling from non-smooth energy functions without losing the benefits of stochasticity, and 
(2) Smoothing-SG-HMC. 
Further, we analyze its properties theoretically and empirically.

* **Movie Recommendation based on Collaborative Topic Modeling**  
*Machine Learning (10-701), Fall 2014*  
Instructor: Prof. Geoff Gordon and Prof. Aarti Singh  
**Abstract:**  
Traditional collaborative filtering relies on ratings provided by viewers in the movie-watching community to make recommendations to the user.
In this project, we attempt to combine this approach with probabilistic topic modeling techniques to make recommendations that consist not only of movies that are popular in the community, but also those that are similar in content to movies that the user has enjoyed in the past.

* **Static Vehicle Detection and Analysis in Aerial Imagery using Depth**  
*Internship at [IRIS](http://iris.usc.edu/iris.html), University of Southern California, Summer 2013*  
Guide: Prof. Gerard Medioni  
**Abstract:**  
This report proposes an approach to automatically detect static vehicles in an outdoor parking space using depth. 
The relevant 3D information is generated from a Digital Surface Model (DSM), which is a result of a novel and existing technique to solve camera pose estimation and dense reconstruction simultaneously. 
Validation using local 2D features, based on existing methods, is then done to ensure better detection rates. 
Further, performance of the detection system is evaluated by changing the internal parameterization of 3D model generation and the dependence is analyzed.

* **Human Activity Recognition**  
*B.Tech project-I, IIT Bombay, Fall 2013*  
Guide: Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri  
**Abstract:**  
Human activity recognition is gaining importance, not only in the view of security and surveillance but also due to psychological interests in understanding
the behavioral patterns of humans. 
This project is a study on various existing techniques that have been brought together to form a working pipeline to study human activity in social gatherings. 
Humans are first detected with Deformable part models and tracked as a feature point in 2.5D co-ordinate system using Lucas-Kanade algorithm. 
Linear cyclic pursuit model is then employed to predict short-term trajectory and understand behavior.
