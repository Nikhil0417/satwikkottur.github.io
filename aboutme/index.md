Having learnt violin since childhood, I have a great passion towards music.
I play South Indian Classical (carnatic music, more [here](wikipedia.org)) along with fusion music.

I played in more than a hundred conerts at various places like Birmingham (U.K.), Beijing, Pittsburgh, New Delhi, Bangaluru, Pune, etc.
