Having learnt violin since childhood, I have a great passion towards music.
I play South Indian classical music (Carnatic,  more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music)) along with fusion music. 
I performed in more than a hundred conerts at various places like Birmingham (U.K.), Beijing, Pittsburgh, New Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, etc., both individually and as a part of an orchestra.

I continued following my passion at IIT Bombay through many events like Surbahaar, Swar Sandhya, Institute cultural night, classical night, etc.; which are attended by a large number of audience including students, faculties and staff of IIT Bombay.
