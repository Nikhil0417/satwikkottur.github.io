Having learnt violin since childhood, I have a great passion towards music.
I play South Indian Classical (carnatic music, more [here](wikipedia.org)) along with fusion music. 
I played in more than a hundred conerts at various places like Birmingham (U.K.), Beijing, Pittsburgh, New Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, etc., both individually and as an orchestra. 
I continued following my passion at IIT Bombay by performing in many events like Surbahaar, Swar Sandhya, Institute cultural night, classical night, etc.; which are attended by a large number of audience including students, faculties and staff of IIT Bombay.
