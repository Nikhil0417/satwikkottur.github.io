Hi!

Welcome to my webpage.

I am a second year PhD student at ECE department, Carnegie Mellon University. I work with [Prof. Jos&eacute; Moura](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/), in the fields of computer vision, natural language and machine learning.

Recently, I have developed interests in understanding the semantics and semantic relatedness in language with the help of vision.

I completed my undergraduate from [Department of Electrical Engineering (EE)](www.ee.iitb.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](www.iitb.ac.in), in the year 2014.
