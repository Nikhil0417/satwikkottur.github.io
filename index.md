Hi!

I am a second year PhD student at ECE department, Carnegie Mellon University. I work with [Prof. Jos&eacute; Moura](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/), in the fields of computer vision, natural language and machine learning. 

I have recently developed interests in understanding the semantics and semantic relatedness in language with the help of vision. I started collaborating with [Prof. Devi Parikh](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/) from [Computer Vision Lab](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/CVL.html), Virginia Tech on learning semantics through abstract scenes.

I completed my undergraduate from Department of Electrical Engineering ([EE](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/)), [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), in 2014, working under [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/). Feel free to explore around!
